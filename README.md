# Václav Vaník Coding Standard

The Václav Vaník Coding Standard `VVCS` is a set of [PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer)
rules applied to my projects.

VVCS is inspired by [Doctrine Coding Standard](https://github.com/doctrine/coding-standard)
and heavily based on [Slevomat Coding Standard](https://github.com/slevomat/coding-standard).
